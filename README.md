In financial analysis, the moving average (MA) is the average of the price taken over a specific period of time, for example 10 days, 20 days, or 300 days. Moving averages are used to smooth out price trends by filtering out random short term price fluctuations.

The general idea is that when price is above moving average, then the trend of price is moving up. When the price is below moving average, then the trend of price is moving down.

For our final project, we wanted to understand how moving averages can be used to gain insights into trading. More specifically, we wanted to understand this idea of price crossover further through data analysis and using modeling to prove or disprove this idea. We sought to do this by using different models to predict returns using price and moving averages, and then checking whether predicted returns matched with the future prices.
